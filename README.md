# Data-structures

Everything written as part of some university assignment,
The structures are well tested and without memory leaks.

- AvlRankTree
  - The ranks are **Keys** with **Max** values.
- AvlTree
  - *log(n)* complexity operations.
- HashTable
  - Implemented with AvlTree.
  - Dynamic
  - Chain Hashing.
- IterableList
  - Implements `==`,`!=`, and `Iterator` interface.
- LinkedList
  - Doubly linked list.
- MinHeap
  - Getting min in *O(1)* complexity.
- SortedSet
  - Implemented as Linked list
- UnionFind
