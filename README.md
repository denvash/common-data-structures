# Data-structures

Everything written as part of some university assignment,
The structures are generic and well tested without memory leaks.

- **AvlRankTree**
  - The ranks are **Keys** with **Max** values.
  - Merge trees at *O(n)* complexity.
  - Initial tree with an array at *O(n)* complexity.
  - Get sorted array of keys.
  - Get sorted array of data.
- **AvlTree**
  - *log(n)* complexity operations.
- **HashTable**
  - Implemented with AvlTree.
  - Dynamic
  - Chain Hashing
  - Auto shrink
- **IterableList**
  - Implements `==`,`!=`, and `Iterator` interface.
- **LinkedList**
  - Doubly linked list.
- **MinHeap**
  - Getting min in *O(1)* complexity.
- **SortedSet**
  - Implemented as Linked list
- **UnionFind**
